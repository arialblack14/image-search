## Image Search Abstraction Layer

This is another project for the Freecodecamp curriculum. i used the BING API which conveniently provides a node module.

### Objective:

Build a full stack JavaScript app that allows you to search for images like this:
- https://cryptic-ridge-9197.herokuapp.com/api/imagesearch/lolcats%20funny?offset=10

and browse recent search queries like this:

- https://cryptic-ridge-9197.herokuapp.com/api/latest/imagesearch/.

Then deploy it to Heroku.

Here are the specific user stories you should implement for this project:

#### User Story:

I can get the image URLs, alt text and page urls for a set of images relating to a given search string.

#### User Story:

I can paginate through the responses by adding a ?offset=2 parameter to the URL.

#### User Story:

I can get a list of the most recently submitted search strings.
